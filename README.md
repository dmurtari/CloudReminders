Instructions:
-------------

An android development environment must be set up to be able to run our 
application. Assuming [Eclipse](eclipse.org) is being used, [Google's instructions](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/installing-adt.html) can be followed to set up an 
appropriate environment. 

Once the project has been imported into Eclipse, then Google Play Services 
must be imported for use with the project to support Google Sign-In and 
Google Maps. In order to do so, [instructions provided by Google](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html) should again be followed. 

Please note that because of the use of Google Play Services in CloudReminders,
an emulator cannot be used; a physical Android device will be necessary to 
run CloudReminders. The device must be [set up to enable development](https://developer.android.com/tools/device.html). 

Once the development environment has been set up, CloudReminders can be run
from Eclipse, selecting the physical device as the target.
